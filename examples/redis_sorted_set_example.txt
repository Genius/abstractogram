sorted set key = "abstractogram:2014"

each pair of (member => score) looks like:

  ruby => 45,
  turbolinks => 2,
  ember => 3

then if someone searches for "ember", we can get the number of times ember appeared in 2014 with redis's zscore command:

redis.zscore("abstractogram:2014", "ember")
# => 3
